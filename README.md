## What is Koor Storage Distribution?

The Koor Storage Distribution is an open source **cloud-native storage orchestrator** for Ceph on Kubernetes, forked from the [Rook open source project](https://github.com/rook/rook).

Koor Storage Distribution turns Ceph into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. Koor Storage Distribution uses the facilities provided by the underlying cloud-native container management, scheduling and orchestration platform to perform its duties.

Koor Storage Distribution integrates deeply into cloud native environments leveraging extension points and providing a seamless experience for scheduling, lifecycle management, resource management, security, monitoring, and user experience.

The Rook project is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) as a [graduated](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/10/07/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-rook-graduation/) level project. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how Rook plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/01/29/cncf-host-rook-project-cloud-native-storage-capabilities).
