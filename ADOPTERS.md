## Rook Adopters

* [Calit2 (California Institute for Telecommunications and Information
  Technology)](http://www.calit2.net/) is one of 4 institutes formed by a joint partnership of
  University of California and the state of California with the goal of *"inventing the university
  research environment of the future"*.  They operate one of the largest known Rook clusters in
  production and they are using Rook to provide cheap, reliable, and fast storage to scientific
  users.
* [NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration)](https://www.nav.no/) is the current Norwegian
  public welfare agency, responsible for 1/3 of the state budget of Norway. They find a massive
  simplification of management and maintenance for their Ceph clusters by adopting Rook.
* [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) delivers *"SaaS On-Prem"* and are the creators of
  open-source [kURL](https://kurl.sh/): a custom Kubernetes distro creator that software vendors use
  to package and distribute production-grade Kubernetes infrastructure. Rook is a default add-on in
  kURL, so all installations include Rook to manage highly available storage that the software
  vendor can depend on.
* [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) is building the largest and most comprehensive music database
  and marketplace in the world and services millions of users all across the globe. Rook enables

  to financial institutions across Europe. Rook has been running flawlessly for them across many
  versions and upgrades, and delivers the performance and resilience they require for their most

  small-medium enterprises in the CENGN labs.

  that lets them take advantage of a mature storage product with ease and peace of mind.
